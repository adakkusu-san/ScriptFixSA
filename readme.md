ScriptFixSA aims to provide bugfixes and quality of life improvements to the original scripts. It also restores some of the cut content, but only the type that was cut unintentionally (due to a code bug) or something that developers likely forgot to add due to tight deadlines and that doesn't break the plot, characters or game's lore. There's no intent to reuse every bit of unused content for the sake of it, or to recreate cut/rumored missions. Based off of [UndefinifiedGrove](https://github.com/Sergeanur/UndefinifiedGrove). Heavily inspired by [SCFIX-Liberty](https://github.com/Sergeanur/SCFIX-Liberty), [SCFIX-Miami](https://github.com/Sergeanur/SCFIX-Miami), [GTA-SA---SCM-Fixes](https://github.com/Domiiniik/GTA-SA---SCM-Fixes) and [TTDISA](https://gtaforums.com/topic/939012-things-to-do-in-san-andreas-volume-ii/)

Relevant or otherwise interesting changes to the scripts were marked with a `FIXEDGROVE` comment.

New global variables are stored in Hotdog.sc to avoid changing vanilla offsets.

Currently in beta status.

## Save files compatibility

At this point it's incompatible with old save files made with original script. In future it's possible to come up with a save file converter once a stable release will be decided upon.

## Mod compatibility

This mod adds some global variables at the end of the list, so you may need to be careful with CLEO scripts
that add new global variables.

If using SilentPatch, it's recommended to set `EnableScriptFixes` to `-1` in its .ini file, although not strictly necessary because SP is designed to bail out any script fixes if the code doesn't match. Doing so also stops the save pickup inside Madd Dogg's mansion from being relocated since a different method is used to fix the "Basketball Glitch".

## How to compile

You need to get sc.exe from 3master and then patch the 3master plague out of it. Also you need some extra files for sc.exe to work properly.
To patch sc.exe, put it in `patch` directory and launch **xdelta3.bat**. Then take sc.exe back to `data` directory and take these files from `patch` directory too: `AudioEvents_PS2.txt`, `AudioEvents_PC.txt`, `AudioEvents_XBOX.txt`, `HID_Base.h`, `TouchInterface_SA.h`.

Notes and pro tips:
- Changing target platform via command line is possible only for PC. To pick different platform you must launch sc.exe, pick it in Target, and then close it. The target platform will be saved in a registry key. Then you can compile sc with command line, the platform you chose will be saved
- I don't know what Xbox 360 target does. Since it's a plague leftover I just ignore it and so should you.
- Compiled OG files always had debug lines converted to UPPERCASE, however plagued sc.exe doesn't do that and leaves case as is. I decided not to bother patching that for now, since it's a benign side effect.
